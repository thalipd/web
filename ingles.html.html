<h2>WRITE A PARAGRAPH ABOUT THE CURRENT SITUATION IN ECUADOR ABOUTSECURITY, WRITE AN EXAMPLE. </h2>
<p>Currently, Ecuador is facing a security crisis, with increasing cases of femicide, homicide, robberies of premises or small businesses, cases of hitmen, among others. These facts make Ecuador an insecure and vulnerable country in terms of security. Example It is the story of Abigail Supliguicha Carchi, a 19-year-old native of Orellana, a friend, companion and confidant, with an infectious smile and lively eyes, according to her classmates. 

On October 7, 2023, the young woman had gone out for a meeting with a man, whom she had met through social networks. 

 Nobody knew about that meeting, until, the next day, October 8, she was reported missing by family and friends. The days passed without positive results and in the midst of the pain and despair of the family, friends and university colleagues. Nobody knew anything, little by little and in the face of what they call “negligence” in the investigative process, it was the kids from the university who apparently assumed the role of investigators. According to the camera scan, they would have gone to the Cuenca land terminal to take a bus to Azogues, a destination they never reached. The body was in a state of decomposition in the middle of the Rayoloma forest, Zumbahuayco sector, via Cuenca- Azogues, near the Javier Loyola parish, 25 kilometers east of Cuenca, in a state of decomposition. </p>
